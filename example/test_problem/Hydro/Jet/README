1. Ref: Molnar, S., Schive, H-Y., et al., 2017, ApJ, 835, 57

2. For hydrostatic equilibrium (i.e., with JET_HSE enabled), one must
   manually copy the file "CUPOT_ExternalAcc.cu" to "src/SelfGravity/GPU_Gravity/"
3. Recommended boundary conditions:
      With JET_HSE and large Jet_BgVel_y: user-defined BC on -y and outflow BC on other faces
      Without JET_HSET: outflow BC on all faces
4. Currently it does NOT work with multiple jet sources
   --> Jet_NJet must be 1
