Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable :
        MODEL=HYDRO
        EOS=EOS_GAMMA_CR
        COSMIC_RAY
        MICROPHYSICS
        CR_DIFFUSION
Disable:
        COMOVING
        PARTICLE
        GRAVITY


Default setup:
========================================
None

Note:
========================================
1. The analytical of CR_Diffusion_Type={0,1,2,3} need to set all fluid to be fixed but cosmic ray.
2. The CR_Diffusion_Type={1,2} are 2D simulation only
3. If your simulation is 2D and want to run in the xz plane, you should set CR_Diffusion_G{X,Z} to 1 and CR_Diffusion_GY to 0
4. An analytical solution of CR_Diffusion_Type={0,1,2,3} script is given as `ana_solution.py`.
