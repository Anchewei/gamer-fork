Note:
========================================
1. Cosmological large-scale structure simulations using hybrid scheme

2. Download the IC file: sh download_light_halo_ic.sh or sh download_heavy_halo_ic.sh
   The wave IC consisting of two blocks of real and imaginary parts are converted to hybrid IC
   consisting of two blocks with the density and phase fields using the Python script ELBDM_WAVE2HYBRID_IC.py

3. The simulation uses a low base-level resolution of 2.8/64 ~ 44 kpc/h (comoving).
   This corresponds to a maximum wave vector k ~ 72 h/Mpc well above the cutoff power in the initial conditions for m = 2.0e-23 eV.
   This initial resolution has shown very good agreement with higher resolution wave initial conditions.

4. The simulation uses the fluid solver on levels 0 - 3 and switches to the wave solver in regions of interference on level 4.
   The minimum resolution for the wave solver 2.8/(64*2^4) ~ 2.75 kpc/h (comoving).
   This resolution has shown to be a good compromise for the starting resolution of the wave solver.
   It does not lead to excessive overrefinement of regions with interference and was sufficient to resolve the de Broglie wavelength close to the
   infall regions.

3. Default maximum resolution is low
   --> Only 2.8/(64*2^6) ~ 0.7 kpc/h (comoving)
   --> Can only marginally resolve a central soliton

4. Some yt visualization scripts are put in "plot_script"
